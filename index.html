    <h2>Work Experience</h2>    
    <ul>
        <li><h3>LECTURER III - Federal College of Fisheries and Marine Technology (FCFMT).</h3></LECTURER></h3></li>
        <p>2019 – Present</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Instructed Electro-Technology classes and organized workshops and seminars focused on enhancing students' practical understanding of key concepts in electrical engineering. Topics included alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) principles, the operation and utilization of AC and DC generators, the functionality and application of AC and DC motors, as well as the use of transformers in electrical engineering, among other related subjects.</li>
            <li>InstruIcted Electrical Engineering Science classes and facilitated workshops and seminars to empower students with fundamental knowledge in electrical engineering. Key topics covered included the fundamental principles of current flow, the practical application of Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws, the concepts of power and energy, the principles of electromagnetic induction, the fundamental aspects of electrostatics, and the essentials of alternating current (AC) theory, among other essential subject matters.</li>
            <li>Instructed Basic Electronics and Instrumentation classes, while also organizing workshops and seminars to equip students with a solid grasp of fundamental concepts. This included topics such as semiconductors, P-N junctions, diodes, transistors, as well as analog and digital instruments, among other essential components of the subject.</li>
            <li>Conducted routine maintenance on the electrical/electronics laboratory, ensuring the optimal working condition of all electrical equipment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Achievement</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I spearheaded a project titled 'Optimal Placement and Sizing of Distribution Static Synchronous Compensator (DSTATCOM) for Voltage Stability and Loss Reduction in a Distribution Network.' This research involved the utilization of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques to identify the most advantageous placement and sizing for DSTATCOM units. The goal was to mitigate real power loss, improve voltage profiles, and enhance voltage stability within the 11kV Thinkers Corner distribution network in Enugu state. The project included comprehensive simulations of the proposed system, employing MATLAB simulation codes to analyze the system's performance improvements pre- and post-DSTATCOM implementation.</li>
            <li>I served as a committee member alongside Winrock International and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in a collaborative effort to assist our institution, the Federal College of Fisheries and Marine Technology (FCFMT), in shaping its academic enhancement strategy and comprehensive roadmap for the forthcoming five years. In this capacity, I conducted an in-depth institutional assessment and actively contributed to the formulation of an Education and Training improvement plan for the faculty of engineering. My insights were instrumental in shaping the organization's Action Plan for the future.</li>
